# Cloud Computing 

**Cloud computing** is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

## The goal of cloud computing 
is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs, and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles

## Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics: 

1. Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may increase users' flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or expanding technological infrastructure resources.
1. Cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers. 
1. Device and location independence enable users to access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or what device they use (e.g., PC, mobile phone)
1. Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier, because they do not need to be installed on each user's computer and can be accessed from different places (e.g., different work locations, while travelling, etc.).
1. Multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs across a large pool of users thus allowing for 
    - centralization of infrastructure in locations with lower costs (such as real estate, electricity, etc.)
    - peak-load capacity increases (users need not engineer and pay for the resources and equipment to meet their highest possible load-levels)
    - utilisation and efficiency improvements for systems that are often only 10â€“20% utilised.
1. Performance is monitored by IT experts from the service provider, and consistent and loosely coupled architectures are constructed using web services as the system interface.
1. Productivity may be increased when multiple users can work on the same data simultaneously, rather than waiting for it to be saved and emailed.
1. Reliability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery.
1. Security can improve due to centralization of data, increased security-focused resources, etc., but concerns can persist about loss of control over certain sensitive data, and the lack of security for stored kernels
